# Assessment 1 Part B

Write a Python program called ``intersect.py``. This program will accept the input of two groups of integers. Each group of integers should be entered as a string in which integers are separated by spaces. You need to find the integers that exist in both groups and display them on the screen.

## Example:

```
Enter number group 1: 80 50 63 20 75
Enter number group 2: 66 50 20 1
Result: 50 20
```
